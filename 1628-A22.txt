Well Completion Program Summary: Andrew Platform - Well 16/28-A22 (from A09)

1. Introduction & Objectives:

Context: The Andrew field, discovered in 1974 (Well 16/28-1), has undergone multiple development phases. This program addresses well 16/28-A22, a sidetrack from the existing A09 wellbore (Slot 06), as part of the Low Cost Drilling (LCD) Phase III project initiated in January 2008. This phase follows LCD I (A02/A06 sidetracks, 2005) and LCD II (A14/A08 sidetracks, 2006).

Rationale: With field production declining (approx. 25-30% p.a.) due to water/gas ingress into the thinning oil column (originally ~58m TVD, now ~28m TVD), the LCD project aims to access unswept oil reserves identified via 4D seismic (2001 survey) and reservoir simulation, thereby maintaining field production margins and improving operational flexibility (black start capability, GOR/WC management).

Primary Objectives (LCD III):

Sidetrack wells A09 (->A22) and A10 (->A23) to access combined risked reserves estimated between 2.52 MMstb (downside) and 4.99 MMstb (upside), with a base case of 3.66 MMstb.

Target initial average production rates of approx. 2.5 Mstb/d per well.

Achieve drilling and completion within a target of 65 days per well.

Deliver first oil by Q1 2008 (A22) and Q2 2008 (A23).

Maintain development costs below $3.14/bbl.

Technical Objectives (A22):

Drill and complete a minimum 900m MD gross horizontal reservoir section within the Palaeocene A and B sands (6" hole), targeting >750m MD net sand or until geological TD criteria are met.

Acquire LWD GR/Resistivity for lithology/fluid evaluation and Neutron/Density in the 8.5" section to optimize landing depth relative to the Gas-Oil Contact (GOC).

Utilize pre-holed liner (4-1/2") with external swell packers for zonal isolation, targeting a PI > 20 STB/D/psi.

Optimize well trajectory to minimize gas/water coning.

Ensure well integrity until end-of-field-life (est. 2014).

Completion design to include Gas Lift capability (standard 5-1/2" tubing).

Minimize environmental impact of completion fluids.

Secondary Objectives: Confirm 9-5/8" casing integrity via caliper; acquire temperature data for FIV confirmation; design for potential future gas production or heel perforation (using 13Cr liner).

3. Program Management & Control:

Responsibility: The rig OIM holds ultimate responsibility for safety. The BP Drilling Supervisor (BP Rep) and Senior Toolpusher are the competent persons for drilling operations, responsible for executing the approved program. The Offshore Completion Supervisor provides technical support and supervises service companies.

Management of Change (MoC): A strict MoC procedure is defined:

Scope Change: Requires a new program issue (e.g., major design change).

Operational Change: Requires onshore engineering assessment and approval (e.g., barrier changes, pressure test reduction). Signed documentation required.

Detail Change: Can be approved offshore with notification to the program author (e.g., running smaller OD tool).

Documentation: All changes must be documented on the Changes Tracking Sheet and incorporated into onsite program copies. Safety meetings are required before implementing approved changes.

4. Outline Program:

Lower Completion:

Perform wellbore cleanout of the 6" open hole section.

Run 4-1/2", 13Cr, pre-drilled liner assembly with external swell packers (e.g., Swellfix Packers) positioned based on LWD logs for zonal isolation.

Set liner hanger packer (e.g., PHL Liner Hanger).

Upper Completion:

Prepare and function test 5-1/2" upper completion assembly including: Tubing Retrievable Annular Safety Valve (ASV), Gas Lift Mandrels (GLMs) with dummy valves, Sliding Side Door (SSD - closed), Permanent Downhole Gauge (PDHG), Production Packer (e.g., PES Hydrostatic Packer), Tubing Seal Receptacle (TSR), Formation Isolation Valve (FIV - e.g., Schlumberger FIV*), Tubing Hanger.

Run upper completion assembly on drill pipe / landing string.

Sting into liner top PBR, space out, land tubing hanger.

Set production packer hydrostatically. Test annulus.

Install Xmas Tree, test connections.

Open FIV using intervention (Coiled Tubing or Slickline with appropriate shifting tool).

Perform well cleanup and handover.

5. Contingencies:

Detailed contingency plans cover potential issues with liner hanger/packer setting, FIV operation (premature opening, mechanical opening), well control events, fluid losses (including specific MI-Swaco pill recipes and sampling requirements), and backup packer installation. Troubleshooting charts for ASV operation are included in appendices.

6. Appendices:

Include detailed schematics (cleanout, FIV setup, tree orientation), contact lists, roles/responsibilities, PCE rig-up diagrams, well handover certificate, and troubleshooting charts.

This detailed summary incorporates plausible technical specifics and expands on the procedural aspects outlined in the original snippets, providing a more comprehensive overview of the planned well completion operation.
